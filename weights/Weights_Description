mask_rcnn_ycbv_rgb_part.h5 - Pretrained on COCO weights, standard RGB, YCB Video Dataset,
                             no differences to upstream Mask RCNN, except 640^2 pixel images, only partially trained
mask_rcnn_ycbv_rgbd_custom_da_resnet_graph.h5 - Pretrained on Imagenet, RGBD, YCB_Video Dataset, da_resnet_graph - using
                                                2 consecutive da_convolution layers and a da_avg_pooling as the first 3 layers
                                                , rest is the same, except 640^pixel images
